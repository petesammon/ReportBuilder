Changes from v4.10:
    1. 'lazy-loading' to avoid processing bottleneck of creating all modals on page initialisation
    2. refatoring of script-form.js to remove duplication (new combined section/summary creation code)
    3. change script-form to dot notation instead of bracket notation for summary code
        fixed - custom text not being added to textareas
        fixed - custom text not replacing statements in summary
    3+ updates to stress form and report
