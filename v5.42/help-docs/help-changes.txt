Changes in v4.11 (from v4.10):
    1. 'lazy-loading' to avoid processing bottleneck of creating all modals on page initialisation
    2. refatoring of script-form.js to remove duplication (new combined section/summary creation code)
    3. change script-form to dot notation instead of bracket notation for summary code
        fixed - custom text not being added to textareas
        fixed - custom text not replacing statements in summary
    4. updates to stress form and report

Changes in v4.13:
    1.  update - attribute 'title' changed to 'sectionTitle'
    2.  update - removed 'enableSectionPreview' as redundant
    3.  update - changed all parameter titles to p*
    4.  update - summary:true now used to identify/create summary section (referenced to by {{Summary}} in report)
    5.  update - form selections now persist across template changes

    11. fixed - issue where auto-add-to-summary valve selections are manually unticked, but the 'Normal valves' statement is not restored to summary. 
    12. added - Oncology EF summary statement, but this will need some further thought/totally new form/report templates
    
    
Issues with v5.a:
    X cursor jumping from measurements to contenteditable
    X summary not found
    X button placement - finally solved!
    X modals don't update contenteditable yet
    X section markers on report to define section to be hidden in full when excluded, and to define button location at section start
    X unify modal creation code
    X fix modal navigation flow
    X special rules for summary modal to hide [next] and [-] buttons
    X copy to clipboard showing handlebars for all measurements
    X not pulling EF into summary
    X copy to clipboard needs to remove utton placement markers
    X summary not updating with drop-down changes
    
Update to v5.1:
    Issues:
    X modals don't update report    
    X hidden sections collapse the text area too much, buttons overlap
    X backspace next to buttons, removes buttons...
    X copy to clipboard not excluding sections

Updates in v5.2:
    X reinstate triggersection code
        X seems that this is currently enabled by 'triggerSection' in selection rather than 'defaultHidden' status
        X orphaned code for hide triggered section button

Updated in v5.3:
    X changed to 'modal' instead of 'section' nomeclature (see Changes_v5.2.md for full details)
        X change sectionPreviewKey to modalKey
    X parameter spans now include 'data-modal' (<span data-param="pAorta" data-modal="modalAo" class="param-span">...</span>)
    X sort out green highlighting (multiple applications - should only apply once on textarea rendering: green = variable, yellow = fixed text, orange = manual text)
    X completely new data-flow architecture with central registry created on page load from existing options files
    X hidden groups not re-hiding on [x] button click
    X manual text edits within parameter spans not being stored
    X ? manual text-edits outside of parameter spans - how are they handled and stored?
    
Updated in v5.35:
    X seperate out LV Measurement and EF options
    X add visual EF measurment

Updated in v5.4:
    X significant refactor...
        X remove vestigial lazy-loading functionality which is not being used
        X move to 'never re-render html' model to preserve manual edits in text-area
    X very complex and time-consuming process to get conditional parameters working (<!--if: pRWMAs--> etc)
    X calculate DVI
    X renamed all options files for easier understanding/futureproofing
    X LV Other Comments - automatically adding to summary despite 'summaryOnChange: false'
    X copy to clipboard button needs to span both columns (and/or remove the 2-column structure entirely!)
    X hidden modal needs [edit] button!!
    X colouring of parameters in textarea
    X remove green border from textarea-focus
    
    X allow measurements to be editable
    X units not getting appended to 'manual' measurements
    
    X update parsing file and example file with new measurements

Updated to v5.42:
    (I lost the file changes betwen there and now...!!!)
    summary: 
        X updated central registry 
            X removed modalKey links to parameters (only used for modal creation)
            X all manual text edits entered into registry for persistence (with unique ID)
            X any clearerd text is kept as clear entry in registry (rather than registry entry deleted)
        X ability to use multiple modals to control the same parameters
        X text-coloring enabled and working well
        X added measurement fields to modals (under 'variables' array)
        X minimum dataset modal
        
        - BP on modal not working as expected...
        - additional modal adding summary statements twice...
        

To Do list:
    - hidden sections need some greyed out text identifier...
    - consider template builder to hide/show sections?
    
    - Visual representation of report strings 
        - cursor focus gives box style
        - right click gives options
        - drag and drop possible
        
    - New parsing, calculations
    - Auto parameter selection based on measurements/other parameteres ('algorithm: "diastology" atribute?)
    - Autovalidate operator?
    - Edit measurements in modals?
