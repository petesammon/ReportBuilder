    1.  update - attribute 'title' changed to 'sectionTitle'
    2.  update - removed 'enableSectionPreview' as redundant
    3.  update - changed all parameter titles to p*
    4.  update - summary:true now used to identify/create summary section (referenced to by {{Summary}} in report)
    5.  update - form selections now persist across template changes
    6.  update - reset button added next to template dropdown (clears form selections)
    7.  update - import modal clear button now clears cache of save measurments

    9.  updated - all valve sections to include prosthetic valve statements
    10. fixed - form issue with normal valves summary statement ordering (from 29 to 39 - Ao is at 30, MV is at 40)
    11. fixed - issue where auto-add-to-summary valve selections are manually unticked, but the 'Normal valves' statement is not restored to summary. 
    12. added - Oncology EF summary statement, but this will need some further thought/totally new form/report templates
