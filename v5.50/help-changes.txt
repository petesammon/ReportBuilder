Changes in v4.11 (from v4.10):
    1. 'lazy-loading' to avoid processing bottleneck of creating all modals on page initialisation
    2. refatoring of script-form.js to remove duplication (new combined section/summary creation code)
    3. change script-form to dot notation instead of bracket notation for summary code
        fixed - custom text not being added to textareas
        fixed - custom text not replacing statements in summary
    4. updates to stress form and report
    5. fixed hiddenSection copy to clipboard exclusion
    
Changes in v4.12:

    2. fixed issue with custom textarea not resizing as expected
    
Changes in v4.13:
    1.  update - attribute 'title' changed to 'sectionTitle'
    2.  update - removed 'enableSectionPreview' as redundant
    3.  update - changed all parameter titles to p*
    4.  update - summary:true now used to identify/create summary section (referenced to by {{Summary}} in report)
    5.  update - form selections now persist across template changes
    6.  update - reset button added next to template dropdown (clears form selections)
    7.  update - import modal clear button now clears cache of save measurments
    8.  update - page refresh now completely clears all saved data
    9.  updated - all valve sections to include prosthetic valve statements
    10. fixed - form issue with normal valves summary statement ordering (from 29 to 39 - Ao is at 30, MV is at 40)
    11. fixed - issue where auto-add-to-summary valve selections are manually unticked, but the 'Normal valves' statement is not restored to summary. 
    12. added - Oncology EF summary statement, but this will need some further thought/totally new form/report templates
    
    
Issues with v5.a:
    X cursor jumping from measurements to contenteditable
    X summary not found
    X button placement - finally solved!
    X modals don't update contenteditable yet
    X section markers on report to define section to be hidden in full when excluded, and to define button location at section start
    X unify modal creation code
    X fix modal navigation flow
    X special rules for summary modal to hide [next] and [-] buttons
    X copy to clipboard showing handlebars for all measurements
    X not pulling EF into summary
    X copy to clipboard needs to remove utton placement markers
    X summary not updating with drop-down changes
    
Update to v5.1:
    Issues:
    X modals don't update report    
    X hidden sections collapse the text area too much, buttons overlap
    X backspace next to buttons, removes buttons...
    X copy to clipboard not excluding sections

Updates in v5.2:
    X reinstate triggersection code
        X seems that this is currently enabled by 'triggerSection' in selection rather than 'defaultHidden' status
        X orphaned code for hide triggered section button

Updated in v5.3:
    X changed to 'modal' instead of 'section' nomeclature (see Changes_v5.2.md for full details)
        X change sectionPreviewKey to modalKey
    X parameter spans now include 'data-modal' (<span data-param="pAorta" data-modal="modalAo" class="param-span">...</span>)
    X sort out green highlighting (multiple applications - should only apply once on textarea rendering: green = variable, yellow = fixed text, orange = manual text)
    X completely new data-flow architecture with central registry created on page load from existing options files
    X hidden groups not re-hiding on [x] button click
    X manual text edits within parameter spans not being stored
    X ? manual text-edits outside of parameter spans - how are they handled and stored?
    
Updated in v5.35:
    X seperate out LV Measurement and EF options
    X add visual EF measurment

Updated in v5.4:
    X significant refactor...
        X remove vestigial lazy-loading functionality which is not being used
        X move to 'never re-render html' model to preserve manual edits in text-area
    X very complex and time-consuming process to get conditional parameters working (<!--if: pRWMAs--> etc)
    X calculate DVI
    X renamed all options files for easier understanding/futureproofing
    X LV Other Comments - automatically adding to summary despite 'summaryOnChange: false'
    X copy to clipboard button needs to span both columns (and/or remove the 2-column structure entirely!)
    X hidden modal needs [edit] button!!
    X colouring of parameters in textarea
    X remove green border from textarea-focus
    
    X allow measurements to be editable
    X units not getting appended to 'manual' measurements
    
    X update parsing file and example file with new measurements

Updated to v5.42:
    (I lost the file changes betwen there and now...!!!)
    summary: 
        X updated central registry 
            X removed modalKey links to parameters (only used for modal creation)
            X all manual text edits entered into registry for persistence (with unique ID)
            X any clearerd text is kept as clear entry in registry (rather than registry entry deleted)
        X ability to use multiple modals to control the same parameters
        X text-coloring enabled and working well
        X added measurement fields to modals (under 'variables' array)
        X minimum dataset modal
        
        X BP on modal not working as expected...
        X additional modal adding summary statements twice...
            x registry now tracks summary status and reads to relevant functions
            
Updated to v5.5:
    X page is built initially from registry
    X modals are temporary and built/destroyed on demand (reference registry for build states)
    X results (parameters) and metrics (measurements) are consolidated into registry (instead of seperate stores)
    X units are stored seperately and only appended on report insertion
    
    X ! need to draw measurement units into Stress report (why not working?) - only works on default because the measurements are duplicated in opt-i-parse.js
    X force registry rebuild on template change
    X spLV in non-summary modal adds EF statement to front position (just had to change summaryOrder as modal order determines location on same line)
    x widened measurements table from 260px to 270px (to avoid wrapping)
    x fixed spelling of 'abnormalities' in RWMA summarytext
    XXXX right click on parameter for drop-down options
    - issue with moved parameter string, then update parameter, updates the moved string, but also inserts new string in original location

To Do list:
    
    * for v5.6 - changed processMetricsThroughHandlebars and prepareResultsWithUnits to read from the registry, but most code still writes directly to metrics and results. reverted those functions to read from the legacy objects. The registry is being populated (and setParamValue updates both) but we're not reading from it for rendering yet - that can be a future enhancement when all write paths are updated.
    * for v5.6 - consider template builder to hide/show sections (now possible with multi-modal approach - just make a bunch of parameters with triggers and put them on a modal, ideally add some code to have yes/no options and checkboxes to activate sections)
    
    
    !- refactor to remove backwards compatibility and streamline code
    
    - hidden sections need some greyed out text identifier...??
    
    - Auto parameter selection based on measurements/other parameteres ('algorithm: "diastology" atribute?)
    
    - Autovalidate operator?
